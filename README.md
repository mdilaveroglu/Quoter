# Quoter

This is an Android application I made in my freetime. It is about quotes. The app shows a new quote each day taken from Wikiquote. And it has a popular quotes page that shows quotes from reddit.com/r/quotes subreddit. User also can save qoutes in the app. Quotes can be shared as images with a lot of customization. Feel free to check out the code and use anything you want :)
